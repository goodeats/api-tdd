# Testing Node JS Server

I have extensive experience testing in Ruby on Rails with Rspec, Factory Bot, Capybara, and Selenium. Would like to see how Node professionals test their apps.

# Express Generator

Generated the app with the [Express application generator](https://expressjs.com/en/starter/generator.html).

# Jest

Had to install [Jest Snippets](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=andys8.jest-snippets) so that VS Code would not autofill `it` to `instanceof`.

Using [SuperTest](https://github.com/visionmedia/supertest) to simulate HTTP requests and assert their responses.

Using [http-errors](https://github.com/jshttp/http-errors) to construct error responses.
