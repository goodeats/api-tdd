# Testing Node JS Server

I have extensive experience testing in Ruby on Rails with Rspec, Factory Bot, Capybara, and Selenium. Would like to see how Node professionals test their apps.

## Express Generator

Generated the app with the [Express application generator](https://expressjs.com/en/starter/generator.html).

## Jest

Had to install [Jest Snippets](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=andys8.jest-snippets) so that VS Code would not autofill `it` to `instanceof`.

Using [SuperTest](https://github.com/visionmedia/supertest) to simulate HTTP requests and assert their responses.

Using [http-errors](https://github.com/jshttp/http-errors) to construct error responses.

## Takeaway

I prefer the TDD approach to outline the tasks ahead that I'll need to complete and take them down one by one. Good to see that Node JS makes this very approachable.
